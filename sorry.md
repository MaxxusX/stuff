# yay public apology time!

it seems I have drifted away from what I was supposed to be doing.


I may not support everyone in the aza, but I do respect their goals<br/>and, yeah I hate furries<br/>however<br/>
i wasn't meant to cause/celebrate/whatever any harm to either<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
to **altik**, **alli** and **everyone else in the old server** \[and **the aza**\], and *especially* **sophi**
## Iâ€™m sorry
(also thanks for reminding me)

after drifting away from my original goals, i will now be going back to said goals<br/><br/><br/><br/>
### thank you
