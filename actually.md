# Love fulfills your need for support.

You care and take care for the spider/moth and it cares/takes care of you (doesn't happen)


# Love compels conversation, honesty, and trustworthiness.

You talk to the spider/moth honestly and it talks to you honestly. You trust eachother. (spiders/moths can't talk, therefore they can't be honest, and therefore you can't trust it. Also spiders/moths don't understand human language)



# Love makes you open to sacrifice.

You would give up something extremely valuble to help the spider/moth, and the spider/moth would give up something valueble to help you. (you probably wouldn't do that. neither would the spider/moth)



# Love lasts.

If you can be romantically attracted to something, but forget about it, you aren't romantically attracted to it. Same for the spider/moth. (it doesn't actually love you in the first place)



# Which brings me to my next point, love is mutual.

You love the spider/moth and it loves you back. (it doesn't)
